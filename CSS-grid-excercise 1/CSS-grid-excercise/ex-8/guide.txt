Exercise 8: Naming Grid Areas üó∫Ô∏è

    Goal: Define a layout using named grid areas.

    Visual Change: You'll see a common webpage layout:

    - The "Header" will span across the top two columns.
    - The "Sidebar" will be in the first column of the second row.
    - The "Content" will be in the second column of the second row (wider than the sidebar).
    - The "Footer" will span across the bottom two columns.

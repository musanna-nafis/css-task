    <h4>Styling Goal: Apply a distinct background color, a larger font size, and a left border to only those paragraphs (< p >) that immediately follow an < h1 > element.</h4>
    <h1>Main Section Title</h1>
    <p>This paragraph should have special styling because it immediately follows an H1.</p>
    <h2>Sub-section Title</h2>
    <p>This paragraph follows an H2, so it should NOT be styled by the rule.</p>
    <div>
        <h1>Another H1</h1>
        <p>This paragraph inside a div also follows an H1, so it should be styled.</p>
    </div>

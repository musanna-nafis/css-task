    <h4>Styling Goal: Shift an element slightly from its normal position without affecting the layout of surrounding elements, and establish it as a positioning context for potential absolute children.</h4>
    <div class="flow-element">
        This element is in the normal flow.
    </div>
    <div class="relative-box">
        I am a relatively positioned box. I will shift from my original spot.
        <span class="absolute-child">I am an absolute child.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="flow-element">
        This element is also in the normal flow and will *not* move to fill the gap left by the relative box.
